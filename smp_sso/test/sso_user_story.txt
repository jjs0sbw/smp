SSO user story

Joe has the names of 19 cities that he wants to order using the natural language 
relationship "north-of."  Joe knows that each city is located at a different latitude.
Joe has access to a system that will provide him the real location of two selected cities.
The location information associated with each of the two cities pairs costs $100.00.  Joe wants to minimize the cost of ordering the cities.

Joe also has access to the strict subordination ordering (SSO) web application (SSOWA) that allows him to enter location information about two cities at a time.  The SSOWA contains a main page which displays a graphical representation of the current state of the ordering process as well as process specific data entry forms.

The main page contains three graphic display areas.  The main area that displays the matrix.  Two associated graphic areas that display the matrix row and column numbers.

A data entry form is provided to enter data.

NOTE: This specific context has been chosen to eliminate some of the preparation work necessary in most real world applications.  This preparation work includes:
	1) Agreeing on the natural language relationship semantics,
	2) Creating an agreement process,
	3) Performing the agreement process,
	4) Documenting the outcome of the agreement process.
The meaning of the natural language relationship “north-of” is well established and the location of cities on a map are also well known.  Therefore, steps 1 through need not be performed.

In future work, natural language relationship semantics that may need group consensus will be used to further developed the user story and use cases associated with a specific type of structural modeling.
