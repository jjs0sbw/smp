     <h2>Structural Modeling Strict Subordination Ordering Application</h2>
	 <p>Strict subordination ording (SSO) is a structural modeling method used<br> 
	 to structure a system in a linear order with only one object at each level <br>
	 of the structure.</p> 
	 <p>This web application is designed to assist in the strict ordering of an unknown<br>
	 or poorly defined system.  Structural modeling is used to create a system structure<br>
	 from a disorganized and/or unordered set of objects.  Test methods are provided to properly <br>
	 test the structuring methods and techniques, a system with known order is selected <br>
	 and scrambled into a ramdom system state.  This ramdom, unstructured system is then <br>
	 structured using the methods and techniques associated with structural modeling. When<br>
	 the ordering process is complete, the final output from the process is checked against<br>
	 the known system structure.</p>
	 <p>This web application supports structural modeling by organizing and presenting a web<br>
	 based interface to a  strict subordination matrix.  This strict subordination matrix <br>
	 is used to order 19 cities which have a natural language structuring relationship.<br>  
	 This natural language structuring relationship is "north-of."  Only one city is <br>
	 allowed at each level.<br></p>
	 <p>
	 This section will be improved as the application is further developed.
