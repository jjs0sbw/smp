Application Design Notes
General Subordination Ordering Application

Key Design Issues:
New functional requirements:
-- FR(1) The ability to indicate that two or more cities are at the same level.
-- FR(2) The ability to swap a group of cities that are all at the same level.
-- FR(3) The ability to set a default level indicator.
-- FR(4) The ability to select a default solution strategy.

Functional Requirement One:
The new FR(1) functional requirement indicates a need to gather additional information.
In the strict subordination ordering (SSO) application the only question that was asked
was "is city a north-of city b."  If the answer was no, then it was clear that city b was
was north-of city a.  In the general subornation ordering application there is another
possibility, the cities could be at the same level.  In the general subornation ordering
application, if city a in not north-of city b the question "Are the cities at the same
level?", must be asked.  The answer to these two questions will completely define the 
state of the general subordination ordering between these two cities.
