Application Design Notes
General Subordination Ordering Application

Key Design Issues:
New functional requirements:
-- FR(1) The ability to indicate that two or more cities are at the same level.
-- FR(2) The ability to swap a group of cities that are all at the same level.
-- FR(3) The ability to set a default level indicator.
-- FR(4) The ability to select a default solution strategy.

Functional Requirement One:
The new FR(1) functional requirement indicates a need to gather additional information.
In the strict subordination ordering (SSO) application the only question that was asked
was "is city a north-of city b."  If the answer was no, then it was clear that city b was
was north-of city a.  In the general subornation ordering application there is another
possibility, the cities could be at the same level.  In the general subornation ordering
application, if city a in not north-of city b the question "Are the cities at the same
level?", must be asked.  The answer to these two questions will completely define the 
state of the general subordination ordering between these two cities.

A new text box will need to be added to the usher interface to indicate if the cities 
are at the same level.

A new analysis approach will need to be developed to “swap a set of cities” that are all 
at the same level with a city that is at another level.

A new check box is needed to to indicate that the default “same level” setting is “no:
the cities are not at the same level.”

There are at least two different types of solution strategies:
- start with the first and second rows and work your way down
- select random cities to compare at first.. then work down 

These techniques will be documented as they are developed. 

The general development approach is:
— Create the new GUI elements 
- Create new functions, including:
