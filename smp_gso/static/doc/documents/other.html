	<p>The General Subordination Ordering web application is an application of structural<br>
	 modeling. This document contains development goals, objectives and notes. It is <br>
	 intended to be a repository of design information that may be used to gain insight <br>
	 into the web application architecture. <br></p>
	<p>The primary difference between the strict subordination ordering web application <br>
	and the general subordination ordering web application is the fact that more than one <br>
	city may occupy the a given level in the general subordination ordering application.<br></p>
	<p>This primary difference imposes some new functional requirements on the general <br>
	subordination ordering application.  These new functional requirements are:<br></p>
	<ul>
		<li>FR(1) - The ability to indicate that two or more cities are at the same level.</li>
		<li>FR(2) - The ability to swap a group of cities that are all at the same level.</li>
		<li>FR(3) - The ability to set a default level indicator.</li>
		<li>FR(4) - The ability to select a default solution strategy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Design details associated with these new functional requirements are outlined in <br>
	the document at this link: <a href="gso_design_notes.txt"> Design Notes </a>
