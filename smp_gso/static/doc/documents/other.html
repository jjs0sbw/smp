	<p>The General Subordination Ordering web application is an application of structural<br>
	 modeling. This document contains development goals, objectives and notes. It is 
	 intended to be a repository of design information that may be used to gain insight
	 into the web application architecture. <br></p>
	<p>The primary difference between the strict subordination ordering web application 
	and the general subordination ordering web application is the fact that more than one
	city may occupy the a given level in the general subordination ordering application.<br></p>
	<p>This primary difference imposes some new functional requirements on the general 
	subordination ordering application.  These new functional requirements are:<br></p>
	<ul>
		<li>FR(1) - The ability to indicate that two or more cities are at the same level.</li>
		<li>FR(2) - The ability to swap a group of cities that are all at the same level.</li>
		<li>FR(3) - The ability to set a default level indicator.</li>
		<li>FR(4) - The ability to select a default solution strategy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The FR(1) requirement defines a need to gather addition information.  In the 
	strict subordination ordering application the only question that was asked was 
	"Is city a north-of city b." If the answer was no, then it was clear that city b was
	north-of city a.  In the general subordination ordering application there is another 
	possibility, the cities could be at the same level. In the general subordination
	ordering application, if city a in not north-of city b then the question "Are the 
	cities at the same level", must be asked.  The answer to these two questions will
	completely define the the state of the general subordination ordering between these
	two cities. </p>
