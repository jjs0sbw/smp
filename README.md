# SMP -- Structural Modeling Project

Structural modeling project -- code, document and data repository

### Project Components and Objectives

#### Strict Subordination Ordering -- SSO Web Application

The SSO web application was started as part of the Basis Structural Modeling Project.
The SMP further refines and develops the SSO web application as a stand-alone Javascript
web application that is used to demonstrate this type of system structuring process.  The 
strict subordination ordering allows only one objet at each level.

#### General Subordination Ordering -- GSO Web Application

The GSO web application builds on the foundation of the SSO to create a system structure 
modeling capability that allows one or more objects at each level in the system structure.

#### Central Diagonal Cluster - Uniform Weights -- CDCUW Web Application

The CECUW web application is based on a "connected-to" type of natural language 
structural relationship.  The connected system objects are then analyzed and evaluated
by clustering the objects around the matrix central diagonal.  This analytical technique
produces subsystem views of the clustered system.  Multiple subsystem configuration may
be produced for further evaluation and analysis.
