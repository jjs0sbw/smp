# SMP -- Structural Modeling Project

Structural modeling project -- code, document and data repository

### Project Components and Objectives

#### Strict Subordination Ordering -- SSO Web Application

The SSO web application was started as part of the Basis Structural Modeling Project.
The SMP further refines and develops the SSO web application as a stand-alone Javascript
web application that is used to demonstrate this type of system structuring process.  The 
strict subordination ordering allows only one object at each level.

#### General Subordination Ordering -- GSO Web Application

The GSO web application builds on the foundation of the SSO to create a system structure 
modeling capability that allows one or more objects at each level in the system structure.

#### Central Diagonal Cluster - Uniform Weights -- CDCUW Web Application

The CECUW web application is based on a "connected-to" type of natural language 
structural relationship.  The connected system objects are then analyzed and evaluated
by clustering the objects around the matrix central diagonal.  This analytical technique
produces subsystem views of the clustered system.  Multiple subsystem configuration may
be produced for further evaluation and analysis.

#### Lower Triangular Cluster - Uniform Weights -- LTCUW Web Application

The LTCUW Web Application is similar to the CDCUW web application except the system 
objects are clustered in the lower triangular area of the matrix.

#### Upper Triangular Cluster - Uniform Weights -- UTCUW Web Application

The UTCUW Web Application is similar to the CDCUW web application except the system 
objects are clustered in the lower triangular area of the matrix.

#### Project Objectives

The six listed structural modeling components have been selected to support the general 
objective of producing well-defined and well-documented abstract relation types.  Abstract
relation types have been developed over a period of years.  The content and 
characteristics of an abstract relation type are detailed in the Basic Structural Modeling
Project which is listed as the https://github.com/jjs0sbw/bsmp GitHub repository.

The natural language structural relationship is transformed into a mathematical relation 
using process rules that are properly aligned with the system domain of interest.  These 
five individual web applications are designed to clearly demonstrate these processes on 
domains that contain systems with different semantics and structural forms.
