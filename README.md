# SMP -- Structural Modeling Project

Structural modeling project -- code, document and data repository

### Project Components and Objectives

#### Strict Subordination Ordering -- SSO Web Application

The SSO web application was started as part of the Basis Structural Modeling Project.
The SMP further refines and develops the SSO web application as a stand-alone Javascript
web application that is used to demonstrate this type of system structuring process.

### General Subordination Ordering -- GSO Web Application

The GSO web application builds on the foundation of the SSO to create a system structure 
that allows one or more objects at each level in the system structure.
